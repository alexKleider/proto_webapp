OVERVIEW
========

Pointing your browser at
``file:///home/<user>/<project_path>/index.html`` 
provides a prototype webapp interface developed to 
demonstrate some needed patterns.  Its input (which
the user provides using a file selector button) is a JSON
file of the form of the included ``json.txt`` file.  Once
file is loaded the user can activate processing using a
``Calculate`` button and if the JSON is parsed successfully
into meaningful data, the output is pesented.  Numerous
readings can be supplied.

This came about while in the process of debugging another
project which can be found here:
``https://github.com/alexKleider/util_calc``

The code is released under the terms of the **GNU Public License**
of your choosing.

The author would welcome comments or questions should any arise.
